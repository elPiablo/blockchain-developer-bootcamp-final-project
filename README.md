Seeds for all Seasons – a digital representation of a barter bank for organic food seeds.

I see public goods being intertwined with the world we live in. We share this space with and depend upon so much more than our own species and I believe we urgently need to reconvene our awareness to this simple law of nature. 

Healthy soil is the basis for life on Earth as we know it. Seeds are the primary basis for human sustenance. Food security depends on seed security of farming communities and growers. 

I believe the following lending itself to the need for blockchain technology. However it remains to be seen if the access control aspect lends itself to a consortium type blockchain, or a public blockchain with app generated KYC for user accountability. We need to ensure the integrity of the stars of this endeavour, the seeds.

The app would seek to record and represent the storage of different types of unmanipulated organic and heirloom seeds. There are a lot of projects in different parts of the world using seed banks as a means of coordination and seeds as a token of barter. So the app will simply represent this ‘work flow’ on the ground in its most basic form, and as an open template for future collaboration and development.

Workflow:

    • A grower (user) will be able to register and deposit a new seed variety and be paid tokens in return. 

    • They will be able to withdraw seeds and pay with the same token type in return. 

    • There will be an account holder (seed bank) responsible for authorising the authenticity and storage of the physical seeds and activating the token payment to the grower.
